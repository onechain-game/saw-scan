# Pull Requests

Please follow these instructions when submitting a pull request (PR):

* Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
* Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
* Add the official repository as a remote called upstream.
* If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
* Create a new branch to work on! Branch from the latest upstream/master.
* Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
* Write or adapt tests as needed.
* Follow the code style of the project, including indentation. Use clang-format if you are unsure.
* Run the tests.
* Modify your commit history so that it tells a story using git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
* Write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code, not what you did to the code.
* Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
* From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's master branch.
* If we request further changes push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
* Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).
